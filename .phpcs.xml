		We may want a middle ground though. The best way to do this is add the
		entire ruleset, then rule by rule, remove ones that don't suit a project.
		We can do this by running `phpcs` with the '-s' flag, which allows us to
		see the names of the sniffs reporting errors.
		Once we know the sniff names, we can opt to exclude sniffs which don't
		suit our project like so.

		The below two examples just show how you can exclude rules.
		They are not intended as advice about which sniffs to exclude.

	To get the optimal benefits of using WPCS, we should add a couple of
	custom properties.
	Adjust the values of these properties to fit our needs.
